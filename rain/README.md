## Mandatory Tasks

### Task 0. Rain

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

- Prototype: `def rain(walls)`
- `walls` is a list of non-negative integers.
- Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater - retained.
- Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and - after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will - not retain water.
- If the list is empty return `0`.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]
    print(rain(walls))
    walls = [2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    print(rain(walls))
